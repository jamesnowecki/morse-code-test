# Morse-code-translator

Test to demonstrate understanding and knowledge of JS array iterators and functions. This was the first challenge we were given without much direction, just a problem to solve, after a week of JavaScript. The requirement was to translate a string of text to morse code, and to also be able to translate a string of morse back to text. As a personal challenge I also focussed on maintaining spacing in order to identify separate letters and words in morse code.
